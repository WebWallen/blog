  <!-- Step 1: Specify what should display on Google, Yahoo, Bing, and other search engines -->

  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> <!-- Without this, blogs would look weird on mobile devices -->

  <!-- Step 2: Add open graph tags to make sure your content screams: "Click me!" on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other social media platforms -->
  <meta property="og:type" content="website">
  <meta property="og:title" content="Hi, I'm the Title That Displays on Social Media Shares">

  <meta property="og:url" content="The URL that shows on social media (when in doubt, just give it the same name as your HTML file path).">

  <!-- Step 3: If you haven't set up Google Analytics yet, do so, and then attach the Global Site Tag on EVERY PAGE you want measured -->

  <h1>Big Stinking Header + Headline That Summarizes Your Content (Note: Don't Forget to Include the #1 Target Keyword)</h1>
  <img src="/images/content-feature-img.jpg" alt="For accessibility, explain what this image has to do with your content in vivid detail"/>
  <p>Short and sweet summary that emphasizes what readers have to gain from reading your content.</p>

  <h2>Every Subheader Should Entice Readers to Continue Reading Your Content</h2>
  <h4>Using a Subsubheader Makes Your Content Easier on the Eyes (It's Boosted the "Time on Page" for My Pet Adoption Blog Big Time)</h4>
  <p>Keep readers hooked with suspense, moving quotes, fascinating facts, interesting stories, and thought-provoking points.</p>

  <h2>Avoid BIG Blocks of Text Like the Plague</h2>
  <h4>This Is Especially Important When Most of Your Visitors Use Smartphones</h4>
  <p>Paragraphs look more jumbled up on smartphones. For a user friendly experience and high time on page, make the content easy on their eyes.</p>

  <h2>Your One and Only Goal with Each Sentence?</h2>
  <h4>Convince Website Visitors to Read the Next Sentence</h4>
  <p>Yep... that's it! Sounds simple in theory. But it's difficult in reality. The only way to get better at writing? Write everyday.</p>

  <h2>Writing Isn't about You (It's about Your Readers)</h2>
  <h4>Nobody Cares How Smart, Funny, or Qualified You Are</h4>
  <p>Sharing your personality is good. It helps you stand out. Self-absorbed content is bad. It causes people to bail.</p>

  <h2>See How I Sprinkled the Word "Content" in This Blog Liberally?</h2>
  <h4>That Was a Strategic Decision Based on My SEO Strategy</h4>
  <p>Search engines need to know how to categorize your content. Keywords are the magic that makes it happen.</p>

  <h2>Close on a Strong Note (and Don't Forget to Include a Call-to-Action)</h2>
  <h4>For Best Results, Specify a Highly Specific Action You Want Readers to Take</h4>
  <p>
    Use more than one or two CTA's and your readers will do nothing.<br><br> <!-- Don't judge! Break tags are convenient at times. -->
    Read a sales page about a product or service you provide?<br><br>
    Subscribe to an email list or newsletter?<br><br>
    Share your content on social media? <br><br> <!-- Oh look, the keyword appeared again... sneaky, huh? -->
